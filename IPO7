IPO Chart

Input:
• Quantity (float)
• Price (float)

Process:
• Start loop for repeated entries
• Compute total = quantity × price
• If total > 10,000 apply 10% discount
• Add total to extended total
• Display quantity, price, total

Output:
• Quantity, price, total (with discount if applied)
• Extended total for all entries

Pseudocode

Initialize extended_total = 0

While True:
 a. Ask user if they want to run program; break if No
 b. Prompt for quantity
 c. Prompt for price
 d. total = quantity * price
 e. If total > 10000: total = total * 0.9
 f. extended_total += total
 g. Display quantity, price, total

Display extended_total

Problem 2 – Batting Average Calculator

Input:
• Last name (string)
• Hits (float)
• At-bats (float)

Process:
• Begin loop for repeated players
• Compute batting average = hits / at_bats
• If at_bats is 0, average = 0
• Add 1 to player counter
• Display last name and average

Output:
• Player last name and batting average
• Count of players entered

Pseudocode

Initialize player_count = 0

While True:
 a. Ask if user wants to enter a player; break if No
 b. Prompt last name
 c. Prompt hits
 d. Prompt at_bats
 e. If at_bats == 0: avg = 0
  Else: avg = hits / at_bats
 f. player_count += 1
 g. Display last name and avg

Display player_count

Problem 3 – Trip MPG and Gas Cost

Input:
• Destination city (string)
• Miles traveled (float)
• Gallons used (float)

Process:
• Begin loop to enter trips
• Compute mpg = miles / gallons
• Compute gas cost = gallons × 3.00
• Add miles to total miles
• Add gas cost to total cost
• Add 1 to trip counter
• Display city, miles, mpg, gas cost

Output:
• Destination city, miles, mpg, gas cost
• Number of trips
• Total miles
• Total gas cost

Pseudocode

Initialize trip_count = 0, total_miles = 0, total_cost = 0

While True:
 a. Ask if user wants to enter a trip; break if No
 b. Prompt city
 c. Prompt miles
 d. Prompt gallons
 e. mpg = miles / gallons
 f. gas_cost = gallons * 3.00
 g. trip_count += 1
 h. total_miles += miles
 i. total_cost += gas_cost
 j. Display city, miles, mpg, gas_cost

Display trip_count, total_miles, total_cost

Problem 4 – Employee Pay With Overtime
IPO Chart

Input:
• Employee last name (string)
• Job code (L, A, J)
• Hours worked (float)

Process:
• Begin loop for repeated employees
• Determine rate based on job code
 – L = 25/hr
 – A = 30/hr
 – J = 50/hr
• If hours > 40: compute overtime at 1.5×
• Compute gross pay
• Add gross pay to total
• Display name, hours, rate, gross pay

Output:
• Employee last name, hours, rate, gross pay
• Total gross pay

Pseudocode

Initialize total_gross = 0

While True:
 a. Ask if user wants to enter an employee; break if No
 b. Prompt last name
 c. Prompt job code
 d. Prompt hours
 e. Determine rate based on code
 f. If hours > 40:
  i. overtime = (hours - 40) * (rate * 1.5)
  ii. gross = 40 * rate + overtime
  Else: gross = hours * rate
 g. total_gross += gross
 h. Display last name, hours, rate, gross

Display total_gross

Problem 5 – Tuition Calculator
IPO Chart

Input:
• Student last name (string)
• Credit hours (float)
• District code (I or O)

Process:
• Begin loop for repeated students
• Compute tuition based on district code
 – I = credit hours × 250
 – O = credit hours × 550
• Add tuition to total
• Display student name and tuition

Output:
• Student name and tuition owed
• Total tuition owed for all students

Pseudocode

Initialize total_tuition = 0

While True:
 a. Ask if user wants to enter a student; break if No
 b. Prompt last name
 c. Prompt credit hours
 d. Prompt district code
 e. If code == "I": tuition = credits * 250
  Else: tuition = credits * 550
 f. total_tuition += tuition
 g. Display last name and tuition

Display total_tuition
